# JSObject-Excel-Converter
It's a small project I wrote because I needed to provide language data to the translator in Excel format while working on a project Internationalization.
I use Recursion to check whether it is a nested js object or not, and it has a function that counts the object keys, so you can check whether you are getting a missing output.
